For the demo scenes to work properly please make sure you import the Unity's Standard Assets:

Effects Package via Assets -> Import Package -> Effects (for camera effects)
Environment Package via Assets -> Import Package -> Environment (for water)

NOTE:
For Unity 5.5.0 or higher you have to download the Legacy Image Effects: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/legacy-image-effects-83913
Then you have to restart unity and load the LUT_SurroundDead.png into the Color Correction Lookup Script on camera.
